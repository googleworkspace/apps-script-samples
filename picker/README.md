# File Picker Sample

This sample shows how to create a "file-open" dialog in Google Sheets thatallows the user to select a file from their Drive. It does so by loading [Google Picker](https://developers.google.com/picker/), for this purpose. More information is available in the Apps Script guide [Dialogs and Sidebars in Google Workspace Documents](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/dialogs#file-open_dialogs).

Note that this sample expects to be [bound](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/bound) to a spreadsheet.
