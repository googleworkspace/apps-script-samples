# Gmail Sentiment Analysis with Gemini and Vertex AI

This project guides you through building a Google Workspace Add-on that
leverages Gemini and Vertex AI for conducting sentiment analysis on emails in
Gmail. The add-on automatically identifies emails with different tones and
labels them accordingly, helping prioritize customer service responses or
identify potentially sensitive emails.
