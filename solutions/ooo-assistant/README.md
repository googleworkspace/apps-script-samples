# Build a Google Workspace add-on extending all UIs

**Warning:** This sample builds a Chat app as a Google Workspace add-on. It's only available in the [Developer Preview Program](https://developers.google.com/workspace/preview).

The add-on extends the following Google Workspace UIs: Chat, Calendar, Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides.

It relies on app commands in Chat, and homepage and universal actions in the others.
