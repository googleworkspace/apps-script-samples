# Attendance Chat App

This code sample shows how to build a Google Chat app using Google
Apps Script. The Chat app responds to messages in a space or direct message (DM) and
allows the user to set a vacation responder in Gmail or add an all-day event to
their Calendar from Google Chat.

## Usage

You can follow [this codelab](https://developers.google.com/codelabs/chat-apps-script)
to build and test this Chat app.

To use this Chat app, you must enable the Hangouts Chat API in the
[Google API Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). After enabling
the API, configuring the Chat app, and publishing it, you must add the Chat app to a space
or DM to begin a conversation.

For more information about how to publish a Chat app, see
