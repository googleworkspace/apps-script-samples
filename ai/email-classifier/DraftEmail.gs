You are an AI assistant. Based on the following email thread:

Subject: ${subject}

--- Email Thread Messages ---
${body}
--- End of Email Thread ---

Task: Considering all messages in this thread:
- Help me ${ME} draft a polite and professional reply that addresses the key points from the most recent message(s) in HTML
- Do NOT include subject of the email

Draft Criteria: Consider the following:
* Explicit Questions: Are there direct questions posed to me ${ME}, especially in the most recent messages?
* Calls to Action: Are there clear instructions or requests for the me ${ME}, to *do* something?
* Urgency/Deadlines: Does the thread mention deadlines or urgent requests?
* Sender's Intent: What does the sender seem to want?
* My Role: What am I (${ME}) being asked to do or know?
* Keywords: Look for terms like "please," "urgent," "FYI," "question," "task," "review," "approve," "respond," "deadline."
* Last Message Focus: Give slightly more weight to the most recent messages.
* Overall Significance: Is the topic critical or routine?

Output: Return the draft message in HTML format.
Format: HTML

Example format:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Email</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
  <p>This is an HTML email sent from Google Apps Script.</p>
</body>
</html>
