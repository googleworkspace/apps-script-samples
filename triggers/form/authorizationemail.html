<!-- [START respond_to_form_submit] -->
<p>The Google Sheets add-on <i><?= addonTitle ?></i> is set to run automatically
whenever a form is submitted. The add-on was recently updated and it needs you
to re-authorize it to run on your behalf.</p>

<p>The add-on's automatic functions are temporarily disabled until you
re-authorize it. To do so, open Google Sheets and run the add-on from the
Add-ons menu. Alternatively, you can click this link to authorize it:</p>

<p><a href="<?= url ?>">Re-authorize the add-on.</a></p>

<p>This notification email will be sent to you at most once per day until the
add-on is re-authorized.</p>
